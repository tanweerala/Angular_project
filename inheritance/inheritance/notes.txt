Inheritance
===========
Acquiring properties(specily methods) from an existing class into a new class(The class that is being defined) is called inheritance
The class from which properties are inherited is called super/parent/base cass
The class which has inherited properties is called sub/child/dervied cass

class AA
{
}
class BB extends AA
{
}

Remember only public and protected properties will be inherited by child
In type script properties are by default public

Method overriding
=================
To redefine parent class methods into child class is called method overriding
This should be done when child class wants to change implementation/body of parent class method


Rule:Child class constructor must call the constructor of parent class.Following code shoud be written inside child class constructor to call the constructor of parent class

super(); //This will be inserted by compiler.This will call default constructor of parent class.If parent class does not have default constructor then this code will give error
or
super(parameters);//This will be written by you.This will call parameterized constructor of parent
