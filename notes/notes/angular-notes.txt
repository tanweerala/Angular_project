Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.

The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules. An application always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.

1:Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data

2:Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.

3:Modules, components and services are classes that use decorators. These decorators mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.
