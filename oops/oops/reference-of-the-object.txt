Reference of object
===================
Every object is uniquely identified by using an id.This id is known as reference of the object.Command to create object also returns reference of the object
Program must keep this refernece into a variable called reference variable
Data type of reference variable should be that class from which object is created

let prd:Product; //code ot create reference variable
prd=new Product(101,"Mouse","Logitech",1300);//code to create object from Product class and assigns reference of the object to the reference variable prd

Remember reference of the object will be used inside constructor and methods of the class to identify instance variables.Variable "this" holds reference of the object internally
