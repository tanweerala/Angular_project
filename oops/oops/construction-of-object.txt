Object features as container
============================
1)Holding data:Intsnace variables and constructor
2)Returning data:Getter
3)Changing data:Setter

Instance variables
==================
Those variables that are declared/defined inside class without using static keyword are known as instance variables

class AA
{
  x:number;//instance variable
  static y:number;//class variable
}

These variable are created each time object from the class is created
It means instance variable can have multiple copies in memory
Following two activities are performed in construction of and object
1)Creating instance variables
2)Assigning value to these variables:Constructor is called to assign value
class AA
{
  private _x:number;//code to create instance variable
  constructor(x:number)//constructor
  {
	this._x=x;//conde to assign value to the instance variable
  }
  get x()//getter
  {
	return this._x;
  }
  set x(n:number)//setter
  {
	this._x=n;
  }
}
